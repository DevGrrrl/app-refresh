# app-refresh

## This project details a redsign of the upShop app. 

### Goals
- to redesign the UI of the app, starting with the mobile views first, specifically the 'find a business route'.
- avoid any changes to the user journey that will disrupt the current logic in the code or require significant changes. 

### What is upShop?

An app that allows the user to search for businesses that reflect their values as well as contribute to the upShop community by adding/editing businesses.

### Overview of original design sprint & findings

Coming soon.

#### Finished app

Here's a gif of the finished app. Alternatively, you may view the site [here](https://upshop.herokuapp.com/). There is currently no desktop styling so you will need to use the dev tools device emulator to view (iPhone6/7/8).

Mockup:

Coming soon.

### Next Steps

- add all routes to prototype
- desktop/responsive views
- replace icons
- add modal(?) to values icons to explain what the stand for

Stretch Goals that require larger changes to the code:
- add information page about what the values mean to upShop
- an about page to explain the app
